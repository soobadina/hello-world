# hello-world
just another repository

Just looking at how it feels to work with GitHub
I love the repository
the commit changes
the branch and all how it applies to the master
it's quite intuitive to understand
that I can be working on somehting and the chnages of another person doesn't affect it
until I merge them to the master
